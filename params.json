{"name":"Apai-io","tagline":"Amazon Product Adverstising Library based on PHP REST and SOAP using the Product Advertising API.","body":"#apai-io\r\n\r\nApaiIO is a highly flexible PHP library for fetching the Product Advertising API using REST or SOAP.\r\nYou can either use the built in operations like ItemSearch or ItemLookup or you can implement your own operations which fits to your needs.\r\n\r\nEverything is programmed against interfaces so you can implement your own request or response classes for example.\r\n\r\nThis class is realized by the Product Advertising API (former ECS) from Amazon WS Front. https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Composer\r\n\r\nAdd apai-io in your composer.json or create a new composer.json:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"exeu/apai-io\": \"dev-master\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow tell composer to download the library by running the command:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n$ php composer.phar install\r\n```\r\n\r\nComposer will generate the autoloader file automaticly. So you only have to include this.\r\nTypically its located in the vendor dir and its called autoload.php\r\n\r\n##Basic Usage:\r\nThis library is using the PSR-0 standrad: https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md\r\nSo you can use any autoloader which fits into this standard.\r\nThe tests directory contains an example bootstrap file.\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n<?php\r\nnamespace Acme\\Demo;\r\n\r\nuse ApaiIO\\Configuration\\GenericConfiguration;\r\nuse ApaiIO\\Operations\\Search;\r\nuse ApaiIO\\ApaiIO;\r\n\r\n$conf\r\n    ->setCountry('com')\r\n    ->setAccessKey(AWS_API_KEY)\r\n    ->setSecretKey(AWS_API_SECRET_KEY)\r\n    ->setAssociateTag(AWS_ASSOCIATE_TAG);\r\n\r\n$apaiIO = new ApaiIO($conf);\r\n\r\n$search = new Search();\r\n$search->setCategory('DVD');\r\n$search->setActor('Bruce Willis');\r\n$search->setKeywords('Die Hard');\r\n\r\n$formattedResponse = $apaiIO->runOperation($search);\r\n\r\nvar_dump($formattedResponse);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some very simple examples go to the samples-folder and have a look at the sample files.\r\nThese files contain all information you need for building queries successful.\r\n\r\n##Webservice Documentation:\r\nHosted on Amazon.com:\r\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/\r\n","google":"UA-41769129-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
